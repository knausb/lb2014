      \begin{block}{Introduction}
The causative agent of the Irish Potato Famine, \emph{Phytophthora infestans}, continues to cost billions of dollars in mitigation and crop loss, annually.  Late blight of potato and tomato, therefore, play an important role in world food security.  To date, 26 genomes of this pathogen have been sequenced.  Lineages US-8 and US-22 have been characterized as having resistance to the commonly used fungicide metalaxyl.  The mode of action for metalaxyl has been reported to include transcription, such that RNA polymerases, and their associated proteins, have been promoted as candidate loci.  We present a genome-wide survey of markers which bioinformatically differentiate these fungicide resistant lineages from susceptible lineages and characterize whether these candidate loci contain polymorphisms which segregate in a manner which may confer resistance.
      \end{block}

%Populations occur as assumedly clonal lineages which had been anciently sexually recombinant.

      \item Reads were mapped to the T30-4 reference with bowtie2
      \item Variants were called using SAMtools
      \item Varients were post-processed with custom code
